Repository of my personal portfolio website.

The project uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to statically generate the website.
It is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) on every push to the `main` branch.

Language redirection is handled by the `_redirects` configuration file. Currently, French and English are supported.
